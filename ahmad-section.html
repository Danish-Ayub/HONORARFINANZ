                <p>All strategies of Honorarfinanz AG are based on the "world portfolio approach" and are aimed at
                    people who are interested in long-term investments. As an investor, you have the choice between
                    three performance-oriented portfolios that you can use as a guide. Alternatively, if you wish, you
                    can have your personal fee-based investment advisor put together a very individual portfolio for
                    you.</p>
                <p>Which investor are you? Are you more risk averse or risk tolerant? Every setting has its
                    justification. Test your willingness to take risks now.</p>
